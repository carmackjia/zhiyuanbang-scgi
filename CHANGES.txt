    Ensure that PATH_INFO is correct even with mod_rewrite
    
    mod_rewrite can modify r->path_info.  One way this could happen is if
    the path being served by SCGI exists on the filesystem.  Ensure that
    PATH_INFO is correct.  Thanks to David Binger for point out the fix.

    Document produce() and produce_cgilike()

Author: Neil Schemenauer <nas@arctrix.com>
Date:   Fri Aug 25 15:29:50 2006 +0700

    Remove unnecessary os.putenv() call.
    
    Calling os.putenv() is not necessary since os.environ alone will do
    the job.

    Add more friendly overridable methods in SCGIHandler.
    
    Optional, more user-friendly overridable methods in SCGIHandler: produce() and
    produce_cgilike().  Overriding handle_connection() will still work, but
    overriding produce() instead takes a lot of the household activities
    (reading CGI variables, opening socket for reading/writing, cleanup) out
    of the application's hands.
    
    Another alternative, produce_cgilike(), makes things even easier (at
    least for some uses): it can read its message body from stdin and write
    its output from stdout, and get its CGI parameters from its set of
    environment variables.
    
    Thanks to Jeroen Vermeulen <jtv@thaiopensource.org> for code and ideas.
